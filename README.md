This repository features a few separate files: 
 -  new_csa.ipynb : My partner, Phanindra, created this file and generated the code within it. It features different data cleansing methods that zoom in on and inspect each column individually. I have peer-reviewed, commented, and critiqued various aspects of this code.
 -  Griffin.py : This is the code that I created for this assignment. After renaming columns and converting data types, it analyzes the data from a broader perspective. This code focuses on mean, median, mode, and model based appraoches towards data cleansing. As opposed to my partner, this code highlights more general issues in the datasets, and attempts to improve the accuracy and readability of the data through these different techniques.
 -  Griffin.ipynb : This is the notebook version of the file 'Griffin.py', which is where and how I originally created the code. Since this assignment requires the submission of an .ipynb file, I have converted the original file to this type.
 -  Week 9 Deliverables : This is the document that provides the deliverables for the week, including our Problem Description and some insight into our Data Cleansing approach.
